The Heartbreak Club: One Girl vs One Twisted Legacy

Fairmont High International, Noida

Never in      her wildest dreams         had Kisha thought     she would be 40,000 feet 
above the      ground on her seventeenth  birthday. That too all     by herself. Sure, 
she had four        other students of      Fairmont       High International, London, on 
the same flight to New Delhi, but they werenâ€™t from her section. As part of 
an annual exchange       programme, five students, with overall ace results and in 
their      penultimate year of passing school, were shuffled        between the different 
branches of Fairmont        High, world over.          Five students from        their California 
branch         went to their Sydney        branch and, in exchange,         five students from 
their         Sydney branch           arrived at the California       branch. Similarly, five from 
the London branch          went to New Delhi    (NCR) and vice versa.
