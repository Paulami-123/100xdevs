# useRef()

 **Assignment-1**
    - Create a component with a text input field and a button. When the component mounts or the button is clicked, automatically focus the text input field using useRef.

 **Assignment-2**
    - Create a component that tracks and displays the number of times it has been rendered. Use useRef to create a variable that persists across renders without causing additional renders when it changes.
